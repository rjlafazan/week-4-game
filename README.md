# week-4-game-crystal

This boxing game is my take on a crystal collection game. At the page load, a random target number appears. Each attack move has a randomized value. When the attack moves are clicked, the attack count increases. The goal is to use the correct combination of attacks to meet the exact value of the random target number. If the value is hit, the player wins. If the value comes out too high, the player loses.
